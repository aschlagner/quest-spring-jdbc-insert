# SEA8 - Spring JDBC Quest 02 - Insert

## Challenge: Inserting a school in the database


*Fork* the following repository: https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/quest-spring-jdbc-insert.

**Note: This repository is NOT the same as the one from the previous quest!**

You are developing a Harry Potter fan site and adding extra functionality. As it stands, the site allows you to add a character from the wizard universe of the series.

Luckily, the database is the same as the one used in the previous quest. However, if you have already deleted it, you can import the database *spring_jdbc_quest here*.

The user *h4rryp0tt3r* is also the same as in the previous quest with the same password of *Horcrux4life* and all possible permissions over the database *spring_jdbc_quest*.

> You should start by testing the site and seeing how it works.

**Be sure to check out all the classes within the repository before starting the challenge!**

1. Test that the site is working correctly
2. Make it so that you can create a school via form, on the route */school/create*

## Validation criterias

- The project runs well using the required database and user credentials.
- It is possible to create a school.
- The school displays well after it has been inserted.
- The *JDBC* code is in a *repository* class and not in a *controller* class.
- JDBC resources are closed properly.
- The code is available on GitHub.
